There is no debate over the influence that <strong>Japanese Anime</strong> has had on the world, not only film but in games and media in general. The history of anime to our current knowledge can be traced back to the start of the 20th century.
Without going in too deep on how Walt Disney Productions and early Japanese Animators where inspired by each other, and how each medium evolved on their respective own it is in my opinion a certain fact that <strong>"Anime"</strong> has great influence over many genres and mediums.    


There are many anime titles of <strong>Anime</strong> that has reached great levels of acclaim and many that has just caught widespread attention within their respective genres.

Below are a only a few(at least two) whose titles(in order of release) alone you should know :

Astro Boy originally released in 1963 by Osamu Tezuka, widely revered as the Father of <strong>Anime</strong> as it is know today. It was one of the first anime series to be released reaching world wide fandom, inspiring so many of the anime & manga artists whose works we have today. 

Gundam originally released in 1979 not the greatest of releases of its time, with that said it has a near cult like following after later(magnificent) realeases within the same timeline of the original story arc and paving the road for future titles within the "Mecha" genre. 

Dragonball/DBZ  originally released in 1986 reaching immediate success to the level where it is still the #1 selling Manga in current Japanese history. Need to know more, shame on you.

Sailor Moon  originally released in 1991 not of my personal taste in genre or style it is still one of the most influential titles of its time. Some of the titles I do enjoy that pulls from Sailor Moon are "Steven Universe" & "Star vs The Forces of Evil".


pokemon  originally released in 1996 and later in 1999 hitting the U.S. (bringing back 90's kids some great memories, I know it takes me back to my childhood days.) It has to this day still been Nintendo's lead selling game series and has its anime titles still airing cathing more & more atention of current generations of children and those still to come.


With the above stated here it is my favorite series not counting currently running titles or any long running arcs such as One Piece, Hunter x Hunter & the other top long runners. The list counts down from #5 to #1 and contains my reasoning behind why I enjoy these series.


5.Naoki Urasawa's Monster

My #5 and of the best mystery & thriller titles I have seen to recent date. Characters so deep and a plot line presented so damn well that I believe that it deserves a lot more notice albeit being released in 2004.

4.Akihito Tsukushi's Made In Abyss

2017's Anime of the year as voted by Crunchyroll(http://www.crunchyroll.com/). The most beautifully drawn manga I have come across and also one of the most emotionally attaching anime series I have seen.

3.Mushishi

#3 by a small increment vs #4 due to me falling in love with Ginko as a character from the get-go.
With a premise like Mushishi's and the fact that I am a "Seinen" genre lover how could I not watch it over & over as many times as I have, I don't think you get it more than 10 times already for both seasons It is one of my most recommended titles to new joiners to the "Anime" following.

To me I still can't fully decide which I like more #1 or #2 untill then here it is as they are now.


2.Gen Urobuchi's Psycho-Pass

Psychological, Seinen, Police with a Sci-Fi spin on it love at first sight. Both Seasons are great with me liking season 2 more than season 1, I know one of the select few. I enjoy the setting and the characters especially the main Akane Tsunemori more so than Shinya Kougami thus why I think the second season drives the storyline forward more.

It is receiving a much needed follow-up(mainly to feed my addiction) in the form of three movies

Psycho-Pass SS Case 1: Tsumi to Batsu      - https://myanimelist.net/anime/37440/Psycho-Pass_SS_Case_1__Tsumi_to_Batsu
Psycho-Pass SS Case 2: First Guardian      - https://myanimelist.net/anime/37441/Psycho-Pass_SS_Case_2__First_Guardian

1.Shirow Masamune's Ghost In The Shell

The original 1996 movie directed by The Man, The Master Mamoru Oshi has been one of my main reasons for being such a fan of anime and probably the main reason that I love the above listed genres, because as a kid it caught my ADHD attention with such greatness that the first time I found out that there existed a 26 episode series by the name of Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex 1st Gig. I had to watch it with, but me at my childhood level of understanding, having to watch it secral times
(also causing me to read J.D. Salanger's Catcher in the Rye - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye) 
to understand and truly comprehend how empty I was waiting for a second season, enter Second Gig.
After watching averything, including the movies afterward hearing wispers(punny) of a re-telling following the Master(Mamoru Oshi - https://myanimelist.net/people/4097/Mamoru_Oshii) 2015 movie, story line Alternative Architecture I gobled it up as it aired.
Needless to say watching the series in this order has brought me the great fascination, understanding and appreciation for this trully masterfull 1989 work of fiction that to this day is still so futuristic that it makes me wonder what this man sees.

1 - Alternative Architecture

2 - Ghost In The Shell 2015 Movie

3 - Ghost In The Shell 1996 Movie

4 - Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 1st Gig

5 - Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig

6 - Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society Movie

7 - Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence Movie
- https://myanimelist.net/anime/468/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2__Innocence

In this order the story somewhat completes the storyline.



This is my own opinion I stand by it if you want to debate it then as the great youtubers say "Fuck You, Fight Me"
